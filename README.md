A C++ library for low-level HTTP stack construction

## What it does
HTStack provides a method to create web applications in C++ using a simple API. It's been purpose-built to handle both production-ready and development applications simultaneously using a single-server/multiple-app architecture.

## Features it currently supports
*   Optional multithreading with a configurable, unlimited thread count
*   Basic HTTP request parsing and response creation
*   Support for SSL/TLS using OpenSSL (beta)
*   Passthrough of requests, so multiple web applications with different domains can run under a single instance of HTStack (WIP)
*   Runtime component updating for fast development (WIP)

## What's down the road
*   Support for various HTTP/2.0 features, namely WebSockets

## Getting started
