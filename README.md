# HTStack
A C++ library for low-level HTTP stack construction

### What does it do?
HTStack provides a method to create web applications in C++ using a simple API. It's been purpose-built to handle both production-ready and development applications simultaneously using a single-server/multiple-app architecture.

### What does it support?
- Optional multithreading with a configurable, unlimited thread count
- Basic HTTP request parsing and response creation
- Passthrough of requests, so multiple web applications with different domains can run under a single instance of HTStack (WIP)
- Runtime component updating for fast development (WIP)

### What's down the road?
- Support for various HTTP/2.0 features, namely WebSockets
- Support for SSL/TLS using OpenSSL
