# HTStack
A C++ library for low-level HTTP stack construction

## What it does
HTStack provides a method to create web applications in C++ using a simple API. It's been purpose-built to handle both production-ready and development applications simultaneously using a single-server/multiple-app architecture.

## Features it currently supports
-   Optional multithreading with a configurable, unlimited thread count
-   Basic HTTP request parsing and response creation
-   Passthrough of requests, so multiple web applications with different domains can run under a single instance of HTStack (WIP)
-   Runtime component updating for fast development (WIP)

## What's down the road
-   Support for various HTTP/2.0 features, namely WebSockets
-   Support for SSL/TLS using OpenSSL

## Getting started
Take a look at [GETTING_STARTED.md](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md) to get started with your own HTStack architecture.
